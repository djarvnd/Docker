Let's start running the containers
docker ps
You can run containers in Interactive & Detached/Background Modes
Run a CentOS container in Interactive Mode
docker run -it centos
The above command will pull the CentOs image
Run the centos image as a container
Then will start a bash shell inside that container
-i asks to keep the input open
-t asks the container to assign a terminal to it
which is why we have the bash shell opened after the run command completes
Once you exit from container, the container is stopped



Managing Containers

Let's manage the containers
docker ps
docker ps -a
To stop the container
docker stop <container-id>  or <container-name>
docker rm <container-id>  or <container-name>
To name the container
docker run -dt --name container1 ubuntu
docker run -dt --name container2 --hostname web ubuntu
